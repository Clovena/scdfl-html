    <p id="overview">
      The Sixth City Dynasty Football League was founded in 2021 as a branch off
      of a standard redraft league with origins in the Sigma Phi Epsilon Ohio
      Zeta chapter. Rooted in Cleveland, 6C is host to members that have now
      dispersed throughout the US. What began as a group of fraternity buddies
      coming together to enjoy the game of football has now evolved into a
      large-scale dynasty league, complete with a full history of rivalries,
      narratives, and statistics.

    <h2>Franchises</h2>
    <p>
      Fourteen franchises across two conferences comprise Sixth City Dynasty.
      Many organizations are based in Canada, but the league stretches down to
      the US and across the globe to Australia.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Teams engage in a 14-week season</strong>, followed by three
      rounds of a seven-team playoff. The champions of each conference are
      awarded the top two seeds, followed by the next best five teams across the
      league.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, each franchise plays each conference rival once each,
      comprising six total intra-conference games. The remaining eight games are
      played against inter-conference teams; a full round-robin to get seven
      games, and then the eighth and final game determined by the previous
      year's standings.
    </p>

    <h2>Conferences</h2>
    <h3>Senatorial Canadian Conference</h3>
    <p>
      The SCC are the older and more prestigious conference. They pride
      themselves on their refined strategies, but opponents might say that their
      lackadaisical temperament has made them no longer representative of what
      their cities want in a football team.

      <li>Vancouver Mounties</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>House of Commons Conference</h3>
    <p>
      The HCC prefer the everyman's approach to football: hard-nosed, down and
      dirty blue collar football that the people love. However, some wonder
      whether or not they are willing to adapt to the way the game is changing.
